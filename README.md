# CS 3240 Semester Project: UVA Craigslist

Our aim is to build an online marketplace for UVA students and faculty to enable them to buy and sell goods and services to other fellow UVA students and faculty. The inspiration behind our approach is modeled after the popular online marketplace: Craigslist.

## Team Roles:

### Scrum Master: 
#### Tahmid Kazi (tk3kb)
The Scrum Master is responsible for keeping everyone on track, facilitating all team meetings, and monitoring team status / issues. The course staff will come to the Scrum Master first if there are any team issues or questions, and similarly the Scrum Master needs to know what's going on with the team and can communicate with the staff if someone is falling behind, etc.
### Requirements Manager: 
#### Henry Nixon (hcn2ey)
The Requirements Manager is responsible for keeping up with "what" it is you are building. This person will spearhead the requirements elicitation process (which takes place in the first couple weeks of the project) as their major activity. Note that the Requirements Manager doesn't do the whole process - they just lead the effort. Everyone else has to participate as well! Then throughout the semester they will update the burndown chart, monitoring the state of the project.
### Software Architect: 
#### Jacob Clatterbuck (jhc5wf)
The Software Architect is responsible for refining and documenting the overall design of the system. The team together should discuss how the system should be built (i.e. what should be a model? what page goes where? etc.) while the Software Architect drives this discussion. The Software Architect will create the Architecture Document, which consists of several architecture diagrams describing your system. Note that the Software Architect is not the "chief coder" and should not be saddled with the bulk of the coding. However, it is likely that the Software Architect is one of the stronger coders on your team, perhaps with some Django or web experience.
### Testing Manager: 
#### Charles Ferraro (cbf6yd)
The Testing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the system is thoroughly tested, for developing the overall testing plan/philosophy of the team, and spearheading the beta testing effort at the end of the semester. The Testing Manager has two documents to create: the Test Plan and Beta Testing Document. The Test Plan is a short, two-page document that outlines what the testing philosophy of the team will be (i.e. every file must have X test cases, every person must write X tests, etc.). The Testing Manager then is responsible for overseeing that philosophy throughout the semester, ensuring unit tests are being written.
### Configuration Manager: 
#### Eric He (eh4xv)
The Configuration Manager is the support tech for the team in a sense. They are responsbile for the management and support of all the systems we are using in the class, namely GitHub, Travis-CI, and Heroku. They should be a person that is relatively comfortable tinkering with computers and settings.
